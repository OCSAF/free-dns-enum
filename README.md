# free-dns-enum

With the freednsenum.sh script you can find domains, subdomains and active hosts. In addition, WHOIS and GEOIP information can be determined automatically. By integrating the ingenious theHarvester tool (https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester), domain information from OSINT sources can be included and then actively checked as a list with all freednsenum.sh options.

## Installation:

The tool is tested on KALI LINUX™ and requires the following packages:
    
    apt-get install geoip-bin
    apt-get install theHarvester
    
## Usage:

The easiest way is to briefly display the Help.
